    ABSTRACT="LIWC is a text analysis program that categorizes words into  grammatical and psychologically derived categories. The currently available LIWC lexicon for Brazilian Portuguese (LIWC_2007pt) is based on the 2007 version of LIWC program. As several studies indicated, LIWC_2007pt shows performance and categorization problems.  In this scenario, this work highlights a new Brazilian Portuguese LIWC lexicon (LIWC_2015pt), based on LIWC $2015$ program. 
This work compares the performance of LIWC_2007pt and LIWC_2015pt in classification tasks. Three experiments were conducted and the results indicate LIWC_2015pt outperforms LIWC_2007pt in all three tasks.",
